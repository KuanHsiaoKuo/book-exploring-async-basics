# Does the CPU cooperate with the Operating System?

If you had asked me this question when I first thought I understood how programs work, I would most likely answer no. We run programs on the CPU and we can do whatever we want if we know how to do it. Now, first of all, I wouldn't have thought this through, but unless you learn how this work from the bottom up, it's not easy to know for sure.

**What started to make me think I was very wrong was some code looking like this:**

```rust
# // #![feature(force_mdbook_nightly_playground)]
use std::arch::asm;

fn main() {
    let t = 100;
    let t_ptr: *const usize = &t;
    let x = dereference(t_ptr);

    println!("{}", x);
}

fn dereference(ptr: *const usize) -> usize {
    let mut res: usize;
    unsafe { asm!("mov {0}, [{1}]", out(reg) res, in(reg) ptr) };
    res
}
```

> Here we write a `dereference` function using assembly instructions. We know there
is no way the OS is involved here.

As you see, this code will output `100` as expected. But let's now instead create a pointer with the address `99999999999999` which we know is invalid and see what
happens when we pass that into the same function:

```rust
# // #![feature(force_mdbook_nightly_playground)]

use std::arch::asm;
fn main() {
    let t = 99999999999999 as *const usize;
    let x = dereference(t);

    println!("{}", x);
}
# fn dereference(ptr: *const usize) -> usize {
#     let mut res: usize;
#     unsafe { asm!("mov {0}, [{1}]", out(reg) res, in(reg) ptr) };
#     res
# }
```

Now we get a segmentation fault. Not surprising really, but how does the CPU
know that we're not allowed to dereference this memory?

- Does the CPU ask the OS if this process is allowed to access this memory location every time we dereference something?
- Won't that be very slow?
- How does the CPU know that it has an OS running on top of it at all?
- Do all CPUs know what a segmentation fault is?
- Why do we get an error message at all and not just a crash?

## Down the rabbit hole

Yes, this is a small rabbit hole. It turns out that there
is a great deal of co-operation between the OS and the CPU, but maybe not the way you naively would think.

Many modern CPUs provide some basic infrastructure that Operating Systems use. This infrastructure gives us the security and stability we expect. Actually, most advanced CPUs provide a lot more options than operating systems like Linux, BSD and Windows actually use.

There is especially two that I want to address here:

1. How the CPU prevents us from accessing memory we're not supposed to access
2. How the CPU handles asynchronous events like I/O

_We'll cover the first one here and the second in the next chapter._

## How does the CPU prevent us from accessing memory we're not supposed to?

As I mentioned, modern CPUs have already some definition of basic concepts. Some examples of this are:

- Virtual memory
- Page table
- Page fault
- Exceptions
- [Privilege level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring)

Exactly how this works will differ depending on the exact CPU so we'll treat them
in general terms here.

Most modern CPUs, however, have an MMU (Memory Management Unit). This is a part of the
CPU (often etched on the same dye even). The MMUs job is to translate between
the virtual address we use in our programs, to a physical address.

When the OS starts a process (like our program) it sets up a page table for our
process, and makes sure a special register on the CPU points to this page table.

Now, when we try to dereference `t_ptr` in the code above, the address is at some point
sent to the MMU for translation, which looks it up in the page table to translate
it to a physical address in memory where it can fetch the data.

In the first case, it will point to a memory address on our stack that holds the value `100`.

When we pass in `99999999999999` and ask it to fetch what's stored at that address
(which is what dereferencing does) it looks for the translation in the page table but can't find it.

The CPU then treats this as a `page fault`.

At boot, the OS provided the CPU with an Interrupt Descriptor Table. This table
has a predefined format where the OS provides handlers for the predefined
exceptions the CPU can encounter.

Since the OS provided a pointer to a function that handles `Page Fault` the CPU
jumps to that function when we try to dereference `99999999999999` and thereby hands over control to the Operating System.

The OS then prints a nice message for us letting us know that we encountered what it calls a `segmentation fault`. This message will therefore vary depending on the OS you run the code on.

## But can't we just change the page table in the CPU?

Now, this is where `Privilege Level` comes in. Most modern operating systems operate with two `Ring Levels`. Ring 0, the kernel space, and Ring 3, user-space.

![Privilege rings](./images/priv_rings.png)

Most CPUs have a concept of more rings than what most modern operating systems use. This has historical reasons, which is also why `Ring 0` and `Ring 3` are used (and not 1, 2).

Now every entry in the page table has additional information about it, amongst that information is the information about what ring it belongs to. This information is set up when your OS boots up.

Code executed in `Ring 0` has almost unrestricted access to external devices, memory and is free to change registers that provide security at the hardware level.

Now, the code you write in `Ring 3` will typically have extremely restricted access to I/O and certain CPU registers (and instructions). Trying to issue an instruction or setting a register from `Ring 3` to change the `page table` will be prevented already at the CPU. The CPU will then treat this as an exception and jump to the handler for that exception provided by the OS.

This is also the reason why you have no other choice than to cooperate with the OS and handle I/O tasks through syscalls. The system wouldn't be very secure if this wasn't the case.
